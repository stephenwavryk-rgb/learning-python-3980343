mystring = "The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog!"
mynumbers = [1,3,5,6,9,12,14,17,20,30]

# the len() function calculates the length of a sequence
# print(len(mystring))
# print(len(mynumbers))

# the max() and min() functions will find the largest and smallest value in a sequence
# print(max(mystring))
# print(min(mynumbers))


# the str() function will return a string version of an object
prefix = "result: "
result = 5
# print(prefix + result) # this gives an error
# print(prefix + str(result))
# print(prefix + str(3.1415))


# range(start, stop, step) will create a range of numbers 
# You can use ranges along with loops 
# for i in range(5, 15):  # here the number 15 is not included as it means the end
#   print(i)
# optional step value
# for i in range(5, 15, 2):
#   print(i)

# for i in range(5, len(mystring), 2):
#   print(mystring[i])


# the print function itself is pretty flexible - you can embed variables directly in it
greeting = "Hello!"
count = 10
print(f"{greeting} you are visitor number {count}")  # interpolated string using f outside the quotes and curly braces to refer to variables
