# Sequences: Lists and Tuples
# These are -- surprise -- sequences of values
mylist = [0, 1, 2, "three", 2.5, False]
print(len(mylist))

# to access a member of a sequence type, use []
print(mylist[2])
print(mylist[-1])
mylist[0] = 10
print(mylist)


# add a list to another list
another_list = [6,7,8]
mylist = mylist + another_list
print(mylist)

mystr = "This is my string"
print(mystr[2])
# mystr[2] = "Z" #can't do this

# use slices to get parts of a sequence
print(mylist[1:4]) # will give index 1, 2, 3 not 4
print(mylist[1:4:2]) # will give index 1 and 3 - steps every second index

print(mylist[::2]) # will give index 1 and 3 - steps every second index

# you can use slices to reverse a sequence
print(mylist[::-1])

# Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable
mytuple = (0,1,2,"three")
print(mytuple[1])

# Sets are also sequences, but they contain unique values
myset = {1, 2, 3 , 2, 4, "hey"}
print(myset)

# Set, however, can not be indexed like lists or tuples
# print(myset[0]) # this will cause an error

# Test for membership
print(1 in mylist)
print(3 in mytuple)
print(5 in myset)
